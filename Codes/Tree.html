		<div id="description">
			<p>The library of the HvA is spread over six locations throughout Amsterdam. Each location has its own collection and hosts a specific teaching domain. The members of the library include students and employees of the HvA and of the University of Amsterdam (UvA) and external users. Users can lend and return a book at any location. For this project, the ciruclation of books of specific teaching domains has been visualized.</p>

			<p>By clicking on the treemap, take a look at the collection. By clicking on a book title, a specific book circulation history will show up in a graph. The map of Amsterdam, are marked with circles corresponding to each location. By hovering over the circles, the contact information fo each location will pop up. By hovering over the graphs datapoints, the details of that datapoint shall pop up which tells you at which date, what actions has been taken. Horizontal lines indicates that the book is at a location, indicated by the y Axis. The vertical lines in the graph indicates that a location transition has taken place. A location transition can be triggered by a "Loan" or "Return action". </p>

			<p> Now go on and discover the library! </p>

			<p><u> A few notes: </u></p>
			<p>
				The circulation history data is unfortunately not real data. The data was generated for excatly this visualiation purpose. 
				The impression has been made that only three actions can be taken out on each book. There are in fact a dozen actions that can happen to a book. Instead of "regular" renewal there could be a "web" renewal, instead of a "regular" return a late return. There can also be actions that involve actions of the library itself, the so called "Interbibliothecaire leningen". These actions are not taken into the data generator because they are difficult to implement since each action has a different set of rules.
			</p>
			<p>
				Last but not least, the treemap only consists of books of the collection of Ã³ne location, the Amsterdam Fashion Center.
				Since it has the smallest collection, the visualization started out with only this collection. It turned out that even "only" 6000 books are difficult to display in a way that is still pleasing to the eye. For this reason the decision was made to leave the collection of different locations out.
