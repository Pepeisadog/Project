## Circulation Visualization
Developed by Sofia Tilon, Amsterdam 2015.

The purpose of this project is to create a detailed visuaization of the circulation of books 
of the library of the University of Applied Sciences.

This was done by making a collapsible treemap combined with a graph,
that indicates the location of books at a certain point in time.
